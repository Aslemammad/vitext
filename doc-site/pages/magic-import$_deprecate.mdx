# Magic import

Vite-pages support "magic import". Magic import is **normal esModule import sytax** with **tailored path convention**. It enable users to import things with special behavior. Users can use it to do powerful things.

> If you are familiar with the webpack loader mechanism, you can easily guess how magic import works.

## Analyze source code

When you are documenting for some JavaScript/Typescript library, you normally want to show some js/ts code to readers. This magic import help you load source code from a module. It is kind of like [raw-loader from webpack](https://webpack.js.org/loaders/raw-loader/). This is very useful for demo code displaying.

You can get the module tree analysis by importing the module with query `?analyzeSource`.

For example:

```ts
import demoSource from '../demos/demo1?analyzeSource'
```

will give you:

```ts
{
  "entry": "demo1.tsx",
  "modules": {
    "dir/util.ts": {
      "code": "the source code of dir/util.ts..."
    },
    "demo1.module.css": {
      "code": "the source code of demo1.module.css..."
    },
    "demo1.tsx": {
      "code": "the source code of demo1.tsx..."
    }
  },
  "externals": {
    "react": "^16.13.1",
    "antd": "^4.4.1"
  }
}
```

Checkout the [analyze-source-code fixture](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-pages/blob/master/fixtures/analyze-source-code/pages/index$.tsx) for an example.

### Relative module dependencies

For relative module dependencies(.e.g `import util from './dir/util.ts'`), their source code will be collected into the analyze result, as shown by the previous example.

Relative module import can be js, jsx, ts, tsx, css, sass, etc.

### External module dependencies

For those dependencies from `node_modules` (.e.g `import React from 'react'`), this magic import will **not** load source code for them. Instead, the dependencies' versions are recorded, as shown by the previous example.

This magic import gets dependencies' versions by find `package.json` up from the importer, and find the package version from these `package.json` fields:

- `peerDependencies`
- `devDependencies`
- `dependencies`
- `demoDependencies`
